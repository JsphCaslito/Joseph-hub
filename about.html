				<p class="essay"> Hello! My name is Joseph Angello Castillo. I am 15 years old. I study at Phillippine Science High School Central Luzon Campus. I am from 9-Arayat. This website was made for my compsci and english project. So if you see this you are most probably my teacher Hi sir :)</p>
				<p class="essay"> My motivation to make an essay about this topic is the because I think that the world is too crowded. When I was on the 6th grade, I usually commute by my self. I always rode a jeepney and a tricycle to school. If I had to go to somewhere further I take a taxi, bus or the train. When I compare the time I take to reach a destination by riding in a public vechicle to riding a private vechicle the difference would be big. One of the main reasons I think that publich transportation is slow is because the government is not trying at all to fix it and the other reason is that there are too much people. 
				<p class="essay"> I think that that was the reason why I chose this topic </p>
